"""
FastAPI endpoint for ending an interaction.

POST /session/{session_id}/interaction/{interaction_id}/end

Called by Exotel (telephony provider) when a call disconnects. This webhook
must respond fast — Exotel has a 5-second timeout and will retry if we don't.

Current design: respond immediately, hand off to Celery for the heavy work.
That part is fine. The problems are in what happens next.

A few things to notice as you read this file:

1. We check transcript length here (< 4 turns = "short"). Short calls skip
   the LLM entirely. That's the right idea. But the check only lives here —
   the Celery task doesn't know about it, so if a task gets requeued after
   a crash, it will re-run without the short-transcript gate.

2. For long transcripts, signal_jobs and lead_stage fire from asyncio.create_task
   BEFORE Celery has run the LLM. The analysis_result passed to signal_jobs
   is literally an empty dict {}. Downstream systems receive an empty payload
   and silently do nothing useful.

3. There is no correlation ID threaded through this endpoint. If something
   fails downstream, you know the interaction_id but not which step failed,
   when, or why.
