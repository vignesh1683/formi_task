"""
PostCallCircuitBreaker — Tries to protect the LLM API from overload.

The idea was sound: if we're sending too many LLM requests, slow down new
calls before the provider starts returning 429s. The execution is too blunt.

Current behaviour:
  - Checks RPM usage against LLM_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE
  - If usage >= 90%: freeze the dialler for the agent for 1800 seconds
  - The dialler checks this before dispatching new calls

Problems:
  1. Binary response. 89% capacity: full speed. 90%: complete stop for 30 minutes.
     There's no middle gear — no "slow down a bit", no "pause for 5 seconds".

  2. Wrong granularity. Freezes at agent_id level. If one campaign is consuming
     all the LLM quota, every agent — across all customers — hits the freeze.

  3. Measuring the wrong thing. This tracks in-flight Celery tasks via an RPM
     counter. But LLM providers rate-limit on tokens/minute, not requests/minute.
     A 10-turn conversation uses 3× the tokens of a 3-turn one. The circuit
     breaker doesn't know that.

  4. The counter is written by record_postcall_start(), which is called after
     deciding to fire the LLM request — not before. By the time the breaker
     could trip, the requests are already in flight.

  5. No visibility. The dialler just sees "circuit open". It doesn't know if it's
     because of a genuine quota issue or a transient Redis blip that made the
     counter stale.

Consider: what would a system look like where the dialler doesn't freeze at all,
but instead naturally dispatches fewer calls when LLM capacity is constrained?
The capacity signal already exists — it just needs to be used differently.
