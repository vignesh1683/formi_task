"""
PostCallMetricsTracker — Records timing and outcome metrics for post-call processing.

Currently: logs to stdout. That's it.

What we can't answer from these logs without significant grep work:
  - What's the p95 latency for post-call analysis over the last hour?
  - How many tokens did Customer X consume today?
  - What percentage of calls are failing at the LLM step vs the recording step?
  - How deep is the processing backlog right now?
  - Are we trending toward hitting the LLM rate limit in the next 10 minutes?

The data to answer these questions exists — it flows through this class with
every interaction. It's just not being captured in a form that's queryable.

tokens_used is particularly interesting: we get the exact value from the LLM
provider on every call and log it. If we also wrote it to Redis with a sliding
window, we'd have real-time TPM visibility. If we bucketed it by customer_id,
we'd have per-customer usage tracking. Neither of those things requires a big
infrastructure change — just a few more Redis writes in track_processing_completed.
