"""
PostCallProcessor — Runs LLM analysis on a completed call transcript.

This is where the LLM quota gets spent. Every call that reaches this class
consumes ~1,500 tokens on average (see settings.LLM_AVG_TOKENS_PER_CALL).

The prompt extracts three things in a single LLM call (single_prompt=True):
  - call_stage: the outcome/disposition ("rebook_confirmed", "not_interested", etc.)
  - entities: structured data mentioned in the call (dates, amounts, names)
  - summary: a human-readable summary for the dashboard

One design observation: call_stage is usually detectable with high confidence
from just a few sentences of the transcript — sometimes from a single phrase.
Full entity extraction and summarisation are only useful if the call had a
meaningful outcome. Whether that distinction is worth acting on is a question
worth thinking about.

Another observation: the LLM response includes a `usage` field with the exact
token count. We log it per call. We don't aggregate it anywhere. We can't
currently answer "how many tokens did Customer X use this hour?" without
scanning logs.
